# hello-world
Hi everyone

My full name is TEMGOUA DONKOO Gilbert and I am a student in Mechatronics, writing my Master thesis
about the subject FPGA-based control of Induction Machine.
I am a perfectionnist so when I am assigned a task, I deal deeply with it to produce the best result possible.
I love new challenges. I am learning Python programming.
